Goals:
</h1>

Let's Learn's goals are to compile multiple teaching sources of various languages and to teach people how to code in their desired language.
The project is currently at its infancy and only three people working on it, focusing on the language Go and Scala.
As time goes on, we hope this repo will get as languages as possible and achieve a great standard in quality, being able to easily teach others.

- We use multiple trusted sources for each language and cross-examine them to create the content of Let's Learn, with each member specializing in a language.
